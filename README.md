📘 Overview

GI Rise: The People's Ledger is a pre-launch, nonprofit-aligned educational project designed to empower underserved communities through financial literacy, coding skills, crypto-literacy, and alternative trust-based credit systems.

We combine blockchain-inspired accountability, real-world community engagement, and DIY coding/earning opportunities into a modular nonprofit framework. This system is not a bank, but it offers bank-like empowerment — without the bureaucracy or gatekeepers.

🎯 Mission Statement

To transform lives by helping individuals rise from poverty, debt, and disconnection into built-up, self-led, financially literate contributors through practical education and innovative tools.

GI Rise believes in a new kind of credit — one based on service, trust, and learning — tracked by The People’s Ledger.


---

🔧 What We Do (Current Phase)

Teach: Financial literacy, crypto safety, budgeting, and coding for beginners.

Track: Time, effort, and service in a community “ledger” using a tokenized point system.

Earn: Members complete missions (education, community work, etc.) to earn digital credits.

Return: Credits can be redeemed, shared, or used to build future credit trust.
